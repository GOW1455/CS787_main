    Output exactly 2 words in the last line, first one is a identifier, named as CS787 and second a single real number between -1 and 1 where 1 denotes strongly buy it and -1 denotes strongly sell it, this is your confidence score. I want skewed numbers and not 0 or 1 or -1 everytime. even if one agent is saying BUY/SELL then the final confidence score should be slightly skewed towards +1/-1. I do not want 0 as the output.
